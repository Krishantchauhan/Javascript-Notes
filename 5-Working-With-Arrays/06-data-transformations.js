/* Data Transformations with Map, Filter and Reduce
Map:
- current * 2
- Multiplies every single element by 2, then create a new array
- Returns a new array containing the results of applying an operation on all original array elements
Filter:
- current > 2
- Returns a new array containing the array elements that passed a specified test condition
Reduce:
- boil all array elements down to one single value
- needs accumulator variable, it will absorbs the array. */
